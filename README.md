## Advice for if you are continuous applying and not getting anything

If you have applied to multiple jobs and not getting any responses you have to improve the quality of what you delivering in interviews


If you have applied to multiple jobs and not getting any responses you need to improve the content of your resume. This can usually be done by adding self driven projects and getting your resume re-reviewed.

If you have applied to multiple jobs and not passing the technical part of the interview you need to at least do over 60 tech problems for SWE and for product management I don't have a magic number but I would keep studying til you get it and do mock interviews with a coach.

- Prep your “why do you want to work there” for whatever company it is
- Come prepared with thoughtful relevant questions and ask them.
- Provide details in your answers; make connections in your explanations
