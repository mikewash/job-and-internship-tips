## Advice for if you are continuously applying and not getting anything

If you have applied to multiple jobs and not passing the technical part of the interview you need to at least do over 60 tech problems for SWE and for product management I don't have a magic number but I would keep studying til you get it and do mock interviews with a coach.

## Stuff to remember before your interview
- Do not use AI to generate your answers real-time
- Catch up on recent relevant events / news and know that anything you mention is fair game for follow-up questions so know it well.
- Prep your “why do you want to work there” for whatever company it is
- Come prepared with thoughtful relevant questions and ask them.
- Provide details in your answers; make connections in your explanations
